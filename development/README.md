# Development Documentation

This folder contains documentation related to the development process of the University Management System. These files are for local use only and are excluded from version control via the `.gitignore` file.

## Purpose

This folder is intended for:
- Implementation planning and tracking
- Development process documentation
- Local notes and analysis
- Temporary documentation files

## Note

All files in this folder are ignored by Git and will not be committed to the repository. This ensures that:
- Official documentation remains clean and focused
- Development-related documentation doesn't clutter the main repository
- Team members can maintain their own local development notes
- Sensitive implementation details stay local

For official project documentation, please see the root directory of this repository.
